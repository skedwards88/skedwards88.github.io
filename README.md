# CnS Games

A collection of short webapp games. All of the games are progressive webapps, so you can install them on your phone for easy access and offline play.

## Development

To add a new project, add an entry to `src/projects.js` and add the project icon to `src/images`.

To view locally, `npm run build` `npm start`.

To deploy, `npm run deploy`. (This is automatically done when there is a push to `main`.)
