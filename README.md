# SECT Games

A collection of short webapp games designed by Colin Thom and build by Sarah Edwards. All of the games are progressive web apps, so you can install them on your phone for easy access and offline play.

## Development

To add a new project, add an entry to `src/projects.js` and add the project icon to `src/images`.

To view locally, `npm run build` `npm start`.

To deploy, `npm run deploy`. (This is automatically done when there is a push to `main`.)
